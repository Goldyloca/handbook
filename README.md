# stanwood Handbook

stanwood's processes and policies

## Introduction

This document will be open-sourced. We are to be "transparent by default". We want to be as transparent potential clients and our team both current and future.

We also want to be an active part of the remote community and want to share what we learned with as many other startups in an effort to bring the wonders of remote work and well paying jobs to the world.

Feel free to ask questions through issues (!add link) and contribute by creating merge requests.

## Lingo

We use UK English both written and spoken. 

We refer to employees and freelancers as "team members" or "Woodies". New Woodies are called "Wookies".

When talking about clients, users or team members we use the plural to avoid female and/or male pronouns. 

We try to use neutral terms where-ever possible. If not possible  we alternate between female and male pronouns.
