stanwood Handbook

stanwood's processes and policies

# Introduction

## Background

We are to be "transparent by default". We want to be equally transparent to potential clients and our team both current and future. As such this document is open-source.

We also want to be an active part of the remote-work community and want to share what we learned with other startups in an effort to bring the wonders of distributed to the world.

## Update the handbook

Feel free to ask questions through [issues](https://gitlab.com/stanwood/handbook/issues/new) and contribute by creating [merge requests](https://gitlab.com/stanwood/handbook/merge_requests/new). When creating an issue, use a link to the line you are referring to for easy access, i.e.
https://gitlab.com/stanwood/handbook/blob/master/mission.md#L5.

Make sure to update the TOC after you added or edited headlines. https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/


# Strategy
## Mission

We are here to build awesome technology the most fun way.

We want to build the largest distributed digital agency in the world to bring the joys of remote work to more developers

To achieve that, we need happy clients.

Clients are happy, when we deliver awesome products in time and budget and give the clients a sense that we are on top of things at all times.

## Values

### I. Enthusiasm & fun personality

We are simply fun to work with (wink)

We are outgoing, confident, charming, helpful and honest.

We communicate openly and timely.

We are not shy, hide in slack or keep grudges.

### II. Time-to-market focus

We focus on shipping stuff to the client and his/her users.

We are super efficient.

We prefer building things over having meetings.

### III. App quality

We produce awesome user experiences.

- Beautiful UI
- Easy to use
- Rock stable
- Super fast

### IV. Strong architecture and clean code

We standardize our architecture to enable fast project switching.

We actively propose changes to our standard architecture.

We write clean code. That incudes

- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Injection
- Single Responsibility Principle (but not strictly adhered to)
- Testable Code
- Short functions - start to finish should be visible on the screen
- Clear and understandable naming

### V. Transparency and openness

We believe that transparency in itself is a virtue. The more we act in the open, the less likely we are to fall victim to internal politics or mistrust.

We also want to enable potential clients and team members to really know, what they are getting themselves into.

#### Exceptions

**Very private **

Some documents are not made public reside in the GDrive of the MD.

1. All data considered private under data protection regulations or other laws.
2. Contracts with freelancers and employees.

**Internal**

Some documents are only available to team members and not the public. They reside in databases, GDrive, debitoor or github.

1. Production client data - only accessible by admins.
2. Client contracts and offers.
3. Slack conversations - except direct messages or confidential discussions in #leads_private.
4. Code and tickets on non open-source projects
5. Passwords and production keys (1password).

#### Openness and honesty

We prefer a hard truth over mollycoddling. But even a hard truth can be told kindly.

We embrace numbers and data over gut feeling or single experiences.

But we also know, that data is only a small part of the truth.

We do not misuse numbers. We know, they are biased and need interpretation.

#### Failure

Human beings have been wrong most of the time in their history.

We try to fail often and fast.

Failure is the best way to learn.

We admit failures - even brag about them.

#### Language

stanwood is an (UK) English speaking company.

With the exception of a very few English is not our first language and quite frankly, it could use a bit of work.

All written and oral communication must be in English. Yes, even between to countrymen.

We try to avoid abbreviations and industry speak as much as possible to enable anyone reading our stuff to follow up.
Only use jargon, if there is no equivalent in normal English.
This also helps not coming across pompous ;-)


We use UK English both written and spoken.

We refer to employees and freelancers as "team members" or "Woodies". New Woodies are called "Wookies".

When talking about people we use the plural to avoid female and/or male pronouns. We try to use neutral terms where-ever possible. If not possible we alternate between female and male pronouns.

### II. Hacker mindset

We work smart:

Automate everything.

Reuse existing solutions.

Do not reinvent wheel.

We work super efficient.

We understand the 80/20-rule.

We constantly review our tools and processes.

We believe in team work.

End result and time to market is far more valuable than personal credit.

### III. Constant change

We always try to improve ourselves and others.

We always try to improve our processes and policies: They should help, not hamper.

We are open to new suggestions and improvements.

We try out new things as soon as possible.

### IV. Ownership

We take personal responsibility for our products.

If something is broken, we make sure it is fixed.

If someone must do something, we pound them into action - repeatedly.

We take personal responsibility of tasks

We never ignore an email or post when someone uses our handle.

We acknowledge questions or tasks within 1h in slack or 24h in email.

If we cannot complete it right away, we give an ETA.

Should we not be able to hold that ETA, we inform the other with a new ETA asap.

We test and iterate our output and our processes as often as possible.

### III. Love it, leave it or change it

We are hackers - we do own things the best we can despite imperfections of outside world.

Instead of complaining we focus on what we can control.

### IV. Respect, Friendship and Support

We are a family and talk friendly, respectfully and helpful.

The team is more important than the individual.

Unless someone falls on hard times: sickness, personal problems, financial issues.

In those cases we support unconditionally.

We embrace diversity.
Nationality, language, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities or mental health.
We cannot have it colourful enough.

We don't disclose what someone tells us in trust.

We support each other wherever we can.

We don't let people go lightly.
We review, feedback, mentor and give second changes.
We help people we let go, to find a new job.

Sexual harassment or discrimination, both active and by passive toleration is not

We do not tolerate sexual harassment, discrimination based on

- Age
- Disability
- Race
- Nationality
- Religious belief or lack of religious belief
- Life expectancy
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Transgender status

, violent acts, threats or encouragement of violence, fighting, bullying, coercion or use of abusive or threatening words directed to, about or against a team member, client or third party, even in a joking manner. Violations of this value is a fireable offence.

We kindly nudge each other should we for instance use the male form of a word by adding the eggplant emoji to the post.

### V. Working remotely

We work where we can work best: near our families, at those places we choose to because we want, not because we must.

We treat each other the same - despite our location.

Working remotely can be a challenge:
When someone annoys us, we assume ignorance before bad intentions.

Make an extra effort at communication.

We want to be able whenever, where-ever and how much we want. Towards that end we build our processes around asynchronous work, document everything and try to avoid the need for real time communication and collaboration.

We do not discriminate for your choice of location of our team members. We pay the same wether you live in London or Bangkok. But that also means, we do not pay for travel time.




# Responsibilities
## General

We need to have clear policies on

- who can decide things
- who needs to be asked for advice
- who should propose

Of course we always strive to involve everyone in all discussions.

## Permission Management

### Background

We are facing four opposing principles when it comes to permissions.

1. Transparency and openness by default: EveryÂ team member should be able to read and change anything.
2. CD/CI: We need to save guard against breaking our continuous integration and deployment or production environments.
3. Data protection: Private end user data (data bases, logs etc.) should be visible only to the smallest amount of people.
4. We do not want a bottleneck on permissions should an admin be not available.

### Principles

1. Data protection: Production data needs to be limited to the least amount of people possible and reviewed regularly.
2. Code, documentation etc: Every team member has read permissions.
3. Write permissions are closely guarded by our Head of Automation.
4. Contact Head of Automation via #operations in Slack if you need permissions.
5. Every admin permission should be with 3 people: CEO, Head of backendÂ development, Head of Automation.



# Roles
## Team lead

### Philosophy

Leadership means: "Take the blame, share the fame."

### Design and implement new features
As a senior developer, you will do most of the heavy lifting during development.

Push back on features that add complexity
Push back on features that add complexity to the project lead. We are not here to solve every client feature request, but look for the quickest, and safest solution that support the code base.

Ongoing bug fixes, and maintenance

Keep project documentation up to date
Work along side the project lead and update the documentation on a regular basis.

### Maintain and manage existing code base
Make sure we are not adding technical debt when maintaining the code base. Should there be a case where the current code base do not support on going development, involve the project lead.

## Project managers

Order of priorities:

### 1. Client Communication

- Keep client informed about progress and blockers 3x per week.
- React within 15 minutes to calls.*
- React within 1 hour to emails.*
- Create tickets to all issues raised within one day.*

* During business hours.

### 2. Jira Hygiene

Every morning:

- zero the inbox
- ping project leads to estimate - if ticket update > 24h
- ping assignee - if ticket update > 1w
- Ensure:
	- tickets are well described
	- documentation regarding that ticket is up to date
	- everything discussed in Slack is synced back to Jira

### 3. Internal communication

Keep Hannes and all devs up to date of milestones, next milestones, of the pressing issues, blockers and goals 3x per week.

Update on Friday till 15:00.

### 4. Fill backlog

Every Friday: Grab the client and fill the backlog of the team according to the project planing spreadsheet for that month.

### 5. Keep documentation and Zeplin up to date

### 6. Up-selling

Suggest features and improvements to clients.



# Tools
## Zeplin

### Background

We use Zeplin to share and discuss designs and also to host design assets and documentation for the developers.

### Guidelines

- Designers: Upload files there and puts sketch file on GDrive
- Tickets live in Jira. But only for briefing and status.
- Commenting happens in Zeplin
	- Yellow: Todo
	- Orange: Discussion
	- Green: Documentation
- Upload a photo and an profile picture to Zeplin.
- Use the same handle as in slack.

## Slack

### Background

We use slack as our daily real time communication tool for projects and our main non-project communication.

### Profile

Add a full name, picture, phone number and email

Username: @firstname if taken @nickname

Same on every other platform that we use.

### Channels

#### #general
Official stuff. Only the CEO posts here.

#### #status

Post "Good morning", "be-right-back", "back", "good night" + what are you going to do today.

The first line of your post and the first emoij will become your profile status message. Use it to communicate your availability to people who try to reach you.

When leaving for vacation please use this template:
`:desert_island: on vacation till August 23rd`

#### #random

GIFs, cat videos etc. to

#### #programming_X

General programming talks and ask for help

#### Tackleberry

Our very own police bot will sent you reminders that require your actions from time to time.

- Tickets that need your estimation
- Tickets that need to be moved
- Tickets that have are already 50% over estimate: Update the `Remaining estimate` and inform your pm
- Tickets that have are already 100% over estimate: Update the `Remaining estimate` and inform your pm

### Guidelines

When responding to todos in slack, open a thread, use "On it {time}" (i.e. "On it in 1h") and "Done"/:white_check_mark:

Project channels starting with "_". All real-time discussion belongs there. acknowledge

Jira, Zeplin, Github, Bitrise post to the channel project channel.

Please do not hold project talk in direct messages, as this is lost to the company. Use a public channel instead.

When asking someone something, always use @username. Some developers are a member of dozens of channels and might miss your question.

Always use threats.

### What to use slack for

- Posting FYI information
- Asking questions
- Assigning non-project todos
- Fun and giggles
- Short discussions (max 5 posts)

### What NOT to use slack for

- Real time discussions: Jump on a call.
- Async discussions: Use Jira
- Async questions or todos (like asking someone who is on vacation more than 1 question per channel)

## Sketch

### Background

We use Sketch for designing all our apps and websites.

### Naming convention

- Digit 1: Epic
- Digit 2: View
- Digit 3: Variant

Example: 1.1.2 Onboarding - Welcome Screen - Disabled

## Jira

### Background
We use Jira as our central tool for organizing our development process around tickets.

### Types of Work

#### 1. Epic

- Group of tasks for a section in the app or topic.
- Usually along the user flow in the app:
- Design, Setup, Onboarding, Section 1, Section 2... , SDKs, Release
- We try to finish epics entirely in a development cycles, so that the client and our testers can fully review that block.
- Tickets that the client actively decides to not implement or fix are assigned to the Version Later to hide them out of the backlog in order to keep the backlog relevant and up to date.
- Each Epic has a link to the github Documentation of that Epic.
- Each Epic needs to have these elements:
		- Link to Zeplin designs
		- List of all UI elements
			- Where is the element getting its data from?
			- Where is the element writing it's data to
		-A list a and description of all interactions including view did appear
		- data was loaded successfully
		- an error occurred when loading the data
	- all possible user interactions

#### 2. Tasks

Has a link to the github documentation and Zeplin of that Task.

#### 3. Sub-Tasks

Tasks are broken down by the project lead into Sub-Tasks.

Each task is assigned to one platform and one developer.
Tasks should not be more then 4 hours or split up into sub tasks
Tasks should be linked to corresponding tasks on other platforms.

MUST NOT have any requirements. Those belong into the Task
Estimation and logging of hours must happen on sub-tasks

#### 4. Bugs

Clients and testers will create bug tickets. Bugs must contain:

- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshot (ideally from TestFairy)
- Details on the device, OS, user and state

#### 5. Client feedback

Clients, TestFairy and crashlytics will create issues as "Client Feedback". The project manager details and reproduces those before changing the type to "Bug".

#### 6. Unclear bugs
If we cannot reproduce a bug, we keep it in the Backlog as an "Unclear bug" assign the epic Later in the hope that someone can reproduce the bug.

### Versioning

We use versions as an additional tool to organize tickets. The rules are loose.

However: When releasing a version to testers and clients a version must put together with all implemented tickets since the last release.

### Statuses

[X. Statusname [Person in charge]: Description]

Inbox [PM]: Clients and tools dump stuff in here, project managers add details

Needs Estimation [Project Lead]: Developer adds an "Original Estimate". // Suggestion: [(developer_estimation * 1.5 )+ 15%(for Code Review)]

Needs Approval [Client or PM]: Clients approves/declines.

Approved Backlog [Project Lead]: Approved by client, but not ready to be taken by developer in this sprint

Ready for Development [Dev]: Sprint backlog, filled by the project manager. Developer takes ticket from there and moves to next status.

Working On [Dev]: Developer implements, (if UI-task: adds screenshots), assigns other dev to code review

Code Review [Dev]: reviewer approves, assigns author, author merges to dev, author moves to QA with QA-instructions

QA [PM or QA Manager]: Project managers: reviews or asks QA-Manager to review. if failed: Assigns back to author working on if approved: moves to client review (if no client: done)

Needs client review [Client]: Client approves/declines 10. Done [PM] (Won't fix [PM]: Tickets, that will not get solved and need no further attention) (Duplicate [PM]: Duplicates, need to be linked to the original first) Crashlytics Issues

PM should create a bug ticket and add the issues link in the description

PM should add a checklist with -Issue Closed

The developer should close the issue on Crashlytics once the bug has been fixed and the ticket is moved to Done

Prio: 'Blocker' We use this to indicate that we cannot proceed with a ticket due to something missing by someone else. i.e. an API to be finished or a design to be created.

The project manager reviews those blockers regularly to check, if the the constraint has been lifted.

#### Guidelines

Discussions on issues belong in the comments in the issue. If something is discussed in slack or in a call, the project lead is responsible for summarising the decision on the ticket.

## GitHub

### Background

We use Github to host our code.

### Gitflow

We are using a custom Gitflow.

- master: deployed version
- develop: clean development version, for testing and beta release
- stage: merged from develop for testing

- feature/SEL-12-awesome-feature
- hotfix/SEL-13-awesome-hotfix (fixing something in master)
- bugfix/SEL-14-awesome-bugfix(fixing)
Naming in Jira

- PR: SEL-123 {Ticket description}
- Branch: feature,hotfix,bugfix/SEL-123-{Ticket-description}
- Commit: SEL-123 {Ticket description} or SEL-123 {Commit description}

### Guidelines

- Never push or merge directly into master and develop. Only reviewed pull requests are allowed to be merged.
- All feature/hotfix branches must be merged into the release branch via pull requests during the sprint
- Commit & push approx. all 3 hours
- Create pull request for every issue before you move to "Code Review" and assign the reviewer in github
- On go live: Lead merges to master, creates a tag and adds release notes from Jira, PM:

### Naming

In order for jira and toggl to auto import the code changes, we need to follow some naming conventions.

This greatly speeds up code review, QA and invoicing.

- Pull request: SEL-123 {Ticket description}
- Branch: feature,hotfix,bugfix/SEL-123-{ticket-description}
- Commit: SEL-123 {ticket description} or SEL-123 {commit description}

`ticket-description` does not have to be exact same as `Summary` in jira. It can be rphrased as long as meaning is not lost.

### Code Review

What to look our for.

PR/CR Guidelines

Only use github comments for the initial and short discussions. Longer discussions should happen in Slack (public project channel). Report the results (+link) of that discussion in github.

When new libraries are added which have not been pre-approved via the library list please include one of the following developers as a reviewer and describe why you used that particular library (and what possible pitfalls it has) in the PR description.

iOS: Ronan, Tal

Android: MiÅosz, AndrÃ©, Sven

Web: Arni

## E-Mail

E-Mails are slow (having to add all those "Hi there, kind regards") and get
un-readable when more than 2 people start responding in a threat.

Also you cannot leave a threat.

1. E-Mails are not allowed for internal communication - except during vacation
and to forward attachments like invoices.

2. When forwarding documents, never zip them. Always use

3. Learn about [filters](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en)
and [search](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en) suffixes in Gmail.

## Bitrise

### Background

Bitrise is our CD/CI for android and iOS apps.

### Guidelines

- `master` and `develop` must always build
- `master` deploys to App Stores or production web server
- `develop` deploys to clients Monday 9am
- Clients feedback come to jira via TestFairy feedback tool



# Core processes
## Developer Operations

### 1. Background

We love to develop apps and websites which will be loved by users and clients.

We want to be transparent and dependable for our client. We also want to sync crowd testing and processes of our clients as well as reduce miss-understandings and unclear tickets.

At last we want to limit crossfire from clients throughout the week and "jumping" in and out of projects.

### 2. Staffing

Every project is staffed

- With a project manager
- One platform lead and one (or more) supporting frontend developer per platform
- One (or more) backend developers

### 3. Timing and Budget

We practice Rapid Software Development. We aim to get apps to the store within 8 weeks after the briefing.

- 1w concept, wireframing and architecture
- 1w design, estimation, setup
- 6w coding (6 development cycles)
- 2w testing and fixing (by crowd and client)

Overhead: We should not spend more than

- 15% on project management (including the project manager!)
- 15% on fixing bugs after releasing the first beta
- 15% on QA and testing
- 15% on refactoring

### 4. The Development Process

#### Weekly cycle

- Project manager move the weeks worth of tickets to `Ready for Development` before Friday noon.
- Weekly staffing and update meetings on Friday between project managers and team leads
	- What did we achieve/not finish last week?
	- Which epics are we tackling this week?
	- Roadblocks: We raise them. But do not solve them.
	- Solving staffing issues and bottlenecks
- After: Team and project leads go through `Ready for Development` and delegate tickets to the team
- Development
- Developers: Implement and review all tickets from the development cycle ready for development till Thursday evening.
- Project manager/QA managers: Reviews all tickets on develop branch and report bugs.
- Developers: Fix those bugs.
- Project leads ensure develop is working and testable build deployed to TestFairy
- QA manager review the feedback from testing agency and create bugs tickets in Jira.
- Project manager distributes the test version to the client with release notes for review

#### Ticket life-cycle

- Project manager creates a ticket, adds the relevant description and moved to `Needs estimation` and assigned to Project lead
- Project lead reviews the ticket for sufficient information and estimates 1h/ 2h/ 4h
- Once estimated, the ticket is moved to `Needs approval` and assigned to project manager
- Project manager (or client) approves, moves the ticket to `Approved backlog` and assigns the project lead
- On Friday, planned tickets for the following sprint are moved to `Ready for development`
- The developer grabs an assigned ticket in order of priority and moves to `Working on`
- Once the ticket is complete, the developer creates a Pull Request assigned to the project lead and moves the ticket to `Code Review`
- Project lead approves the PR and assigns the ticket back to the developer
- The developer moves the ticket to `QA` when the branch is merged to develop and assigns the QA manager to test the ticket
- The QA approves the ticket and moves to Done; the original developer is assigned again
- The QA manager moves rejected tickets are moved to `Ready for development`

#### Guidelines

The person responsible for the next step must be assigned to the ticket. i.e. when asking a question that question that blocks the ticket, please assign the person you asked.

Order of work: Weekly priority sent up until Monday; Priority: Critical, Status: Needs estimation, QA, Code Review, Working on, Ready for Development

All tickets must receive

- Code review
- App/web: a functional review by the Project manager or QA manager
- API: a functional review by front-end developer

#### Pull requests

- Developers creates a pull requests from their feature/hotfix/bugfix branch to develop branch.
- Assigns the Project leads for code review on GitHub.
- Project leads reviews code and approves PR (reviewer is not merging PR)
- Author of pull request merges to develop and moves the ticket to QA.

#### Testing

The project lead developer creates a testable version on Friday EOD.

QA manager ships a testable build to the testing agency.
Each release will be tested by internal testers or our test agency over the weekend.

#### Client feedback

Client give feedback over the course of the week (report bugs, adds request changes).
For that they are invited to do that directly in Jira.

Only tickets we get till Thursday can be part of the next development cycle.

Project managers review, reproduce and detail client requests/bug reports and creates and details Epics, breaks down to Tasks and coordinates priorities with the client on an ongoing basis.

The project lead breaks down Tasks to sub-tasks for each platform and create API sub-task tickete, estimates sub-tasks and tasks (if no subtasks) and moves them to `Needs approval`

### Release policy

#### Major/Minor Release

Monday-Wednesday. Thursday if critical.

#### Hotfix Release

Hotfixes on a Friday, only if 10%+ users are affected

#### Major Releases

Are used sparingly. Only 1-2 major releases per year.

1.0, 2.0, 3.0

#### Minor Releases

Every release with features in it increments the second digit of the version

1.1, 2.3, 2.5

#### Hotfix Releases

Releases that merely fix bugs are incremented with the third digit of the version.

1.1.1, 2.3.4

#### Build numbers

We use automatically increasing build numbers from Bitrise. We use the same build version as Bitrise build.

**Responsibilities**

- @devs: Codes, creates PR and merges
- @project lead: Approves PR
- @qa: Test features on `develop`.

#### 2. Creating a testable version

Thursday evening `develop` is merged into `stage` to have a stable environment for QA, test agency and client approval.

The CDCI auto-deploys to firebase.hosting stage environment.

## API Guidelines

### Background

The decision for an API can have tremendous implications for the overall effort (and pain) of developing frontend. We have seen projects exploding 10x because of APIs we had no control over.

### Preferred solution: 100% control

#### 1. Own API

When we have the need for a complex backend, our fearless backend team build a rock solid, high performance, super scalable, 100% unit tested and monitored thing of beauty on Google App Engine in Python.

#### 2. Firebase

For smaller projects and prototypes that only need light weight auth, data or file storage we use firebase.

**Upsides**

- Do not need an backend developer to build things
- Real time database can function as a mock API (supports most HTTP methods including POST, PUT and DELETE)
- Changes can be monitored in real time
- Super easy integration
- Real time data base

**Downsides**

- Firebase has no build in server side logging and makes debugging a pain
- Changing data models is virtually impossible
- Data can be broken super fast - esp. on production
- Analytics on data structure is hard

### Third party APIs

Should clients force us to use a 3rd party API or one they are building, we always build a proxy.

The frontend developers then draft the API as they would need it.

The proxy then translates between the frontend API and the 3rd party API.

**Upsides**

- Frontend development get's a highly optimized API
- We can monitor the 3rd party APIs for errors and report that directly to the client.
- We can hit cache and prevent outages even when the client APIs breaks.

### Monitoring

We use stackdriver to monitor for outages, errors and speed of the API itself and runscope as well as postman to mimic user requests to do a full end-to-end test of the API every few minutes.

## CDCI

### Web

- Confluence (TBD)
- [Gitlab](web_gitlab.md)

### Web Gitlab

### Gitlab CDCI Web Guidelines

### Steps

#### 0. Get the project deploy from your local terminal

- Install and configure firebase CLI https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/
- Make sure to use the correct folder for deployment, i.e. /dist /public

#### 1. Set up variables in settings/cd_ci

- FIREBASE_PROJECT_DEVELOP
- FIREBASE_PROJECT_PRODUCTION
- FIREBASE_PROJECT_STAGE
- FIREBASE_TOKEN

The central token is in 1password

Do not protect them. If you do, they will not be passed to the dev and stage branch.

#### 2. Set up CDCD file in root

Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file on develop, then merge down to stage and master.

Be careful! This will deploy to production.

```
image: node:latest

deploy_review:
  stage: test
  environment: develop
  only:
    - develop
  script:
    - {ADD YOUR YOUR BUILD STEPS HERE}
    - npm install -g firebase-tools
    - firebase deploy --token=$FIREBASE_TOKEN --non-interactive --project=$FIREBASE_PROJECT_DEVELOP --only hosting

deploy_stage:
  stage: deploy
  environment: stage
  only:
    - stage
  script:
    - {ADD YOUR YOUR BUILD STEPS HERE}
    - npm install -g firebase-tools
    - firebase deploy --token=$FIREBASE_TOKEN --non-interactive --project=$FIREBASE_PROJECT_STAGE --only hosting

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  environment: production
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - {ADD YOUR YOUR BUILD STEPS HERE}
    - npm install -g firebase-tools
    - firebase deploy --token=$FIREBASE_TOKEN --non-interactive --project=FIREBASE_PROJECT_PRODUCTION --only hosting
```

#### 3. Todos

1. Use cached folders to speed up deployment time
2. Gitlab wants testing (develop) and deployment handled differently. Research how that is done.
3. Use centralised cdci file to save config time.
4. Which firebase token should we use?
5. Create artefacts. Ideally we can download a working snapshot from the build.
6. Review if all those steps are required or if we can skip some
	7. npm install -g npm@5.6.0
	8. npm install
	9. npm run build



# People operations
## Recruiting

### Guidelines

As we grow the complexity of operating the company grows. To run our company efficiently every new team member must raise the bar.

Towards that end, every new recruit must be better than the average member than that team.

Preferebly every new recruit is better then any member of that team.

We are accutly aware that hiring is a deeply biased process. In addition to that, mishires are very costly both financially and culturally.

To remedy those biases we created an elaborate process with multiple steps and at least 5 interviews.

### Process

See our private [recruitment section](https://gitlab.com/stanwood/internal/recruiting/blob/master/process.md).

This information is private, as they contain tasks to be solved and questions to be answered.

Being able to prepare in advance defeats the purpose.

## Contracts

As we have access to clients production data bases, we are subject to data protection laws, non-disclosure-agreements and data-processing-agreements with all our clients.

In those contracts we are responsible to enforce the same clauses to all our team members.

Every freelancer and employee needs to sign 3 documents:

1. Non disclosure agreement: [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Iybj-AhccoGngPzFn8lbjRYQZOjL4uFmlt-8q-pbMw/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Data processing agreement: [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ENtLIcJlNJMY42weFzJ5KzskuGcGYVp8fSQJ5moufn0/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Core contract
	4. Freelancing contract: [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cm8LBm9Tu9wxHfxUUhzih0u9gVu2cFFpJIqxOuPDTqc/edit?usp=sharing)
	5. Employment contract: [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMVa-_HVo0tX1oQnxJmjHYp0oxQLP6qh4_hnz23xgt0/edit?usp=sharing)

We only use digital contracts via DocuSign. Paper is a pain.

### Freelance vs. Full time employee

We prefer working on a freelance basis because this

- reduces the accounting and admin overhead by 90%
- captures our entrepreneurial spirit
- is closer to our processes

Some states have "fake-freelancer-laws" that prohibits this practise sometimes. In those cases we go with the employment contract.

## Compensation

### Background

We provide a transparent and unified payment scheme based on hourly rates that reflect the impact for the company, responsibilities and scarcity of the skill set.

### Developers and project managers

- New guys: 25â¬
- Mid level: 30â¬
- Senior: 35â¬
- Project lead: 40â¬
- Team lead: 45â¬

### *QA manager*

- Junior: 15â¬
- Mid: 20â¬
- Senior: 25â¬
- Team lead: 30â¬

We *do not downgrade* existing hourly rates. We will heal the existing "injustices" with a general rate increase in the next years.

### Full time employees

Full time employees get a wage based on the gross cost hourly rate + 20% (employer payment for pension health insurance, ...) x 8 h / day x 220 d / year.


So if an employee and a freelancer work those 1760 h per year, they cost the company the same amount.

220 d is the average per full time employee in Germany.

1700 h was the average of full time freelancer at stanwood last year.

**Example**


*Employee:*

Wage: 40 â¬/h x 8 h/d x 220 d/y x 80% = 56,320 â¬

Benefits: 40 â¬/h x 8 h/d x 220 d/y x 20% = 14,080 â¬

*Freelancer*

Fee: 40 â¬/h x 8 h/d x 220 d/y = 70,400 â¬

## Continuous Performance Management

### 1 on 1 reviews
We do continuous performance management. Leads have regular 1 on 1 reviews with their teammembers.
We center on 5 questions:
- What are you working on?
- How are you doing; how are your OKRs/Goals coming along?
- Is there anything impeding your work?
- What do you need from me to be (more) successful?
- How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals?

This is the teammembers meeting. Tone and agenda should be set by the teammember. The lead is there to coach and learn.

Background information:
https://gitlab.com/stanwood/blog/blob/master/inspirations_from_books.md#L208-214

## People development

### Background

stanwood is the embodiment of change. We want to improve every day. One important step (others are Analyses, Planning, Doing and Collecting Data) is the Review.

### 0. Performance review

Every team member has a performance review meeting with their team lead every quarter.

The Q3 review is the Annual Review where we also add 360Â° feedback.

Apart from a general feedback, your lead will discuss these points:

- Developer ideals
- Team KPIs and how you might contribute
- 360Â° feedback

With the Q1 feedback in 2019 we will add personal goals and personal KPIs.

### 1. Goals

Numerous studies have shown, that setting goals increases a teams performance and personal happiness.

We already have our company goals for each year.

We will start developing (bottom up) goals for every team in 2018 and for every person in 2019.

Those goals can - but must not overlap - with the higher team and company goals.

Goal achievement are purely developmental and will not be tied to your compensation or career.

### 2. KPI

We are blessed with numerous sources of data that can help us understand our performance as a group.

When setting goals we try to use data to inform our decision making.

We also use data to identify patterns and improve our operations.

We never use data to control or punish people.

KPIs are purely developmental and will not be tied to you compensation or career.

#### Developer KPI

1. Estimation accuracy
2. Feature implementation speed
3. Bug fixing speed
4. % worked on bugs vs. features
5. % tickets passing QA on the first try

#### QA KPI

1. % tickets passing QA on the first
2. Total number of tickets reviewed
3. Number of bugs found by client

#### Project management KPI

1. Estimation accuracy
2. % worked on bugs vs. features
3. % tickets passing QA on the first try
4. Project profitability

### 3. 360Â° Feedback

We want to give you a fuller picture of how you are perceived by our fellow Woodies and even clients (for project managers).

For that end we identified up to 7 people each Woody worked with most - that will give anonymized feedback and vice versa.

This survey is purely developmental. Nothing you say here will impact compensation or the career of that person or yours.

#### I. HOW TO

Please choose your feedback partners from this list
Pairings

and leave them a short and actionable feedback here

Form

#### II. EXAMPLES
Keep
"Fun to work with, good mentor, always available to help when I have technical issues or I am blocked with a task."

Change
"Share more from his/her experience in programming channels so I can learn, delegate more interesting tasks where I can improve my skills, "

#### III. NOTES
1. This survey is totally anonymous towards the person you give feedback to.
2. Hannes sees all answers and your name.
3. Team leads see all answers for their team and your name.
4. The team lead will synthesize all feedback to ensure anonymity.
5. If you do not have 7 people on your list, just click "NEXT" and leave those sections empty.

### 4. Leadership feedback

Our team leads will get a bit more detailed feedback.
Every team member will answer the following 12 questions

- My team lead gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
- My team lead does not "micromanage".
- My team lead shows consideration for me as a person.
- My team lead values the perspective I bring to the team, even if it is different from his own.
- My team lead keeps the team focused on our priority results/deliverables.
- My team lead regularly shares relevant information from his bosses.
- My team lead has had a meaningful discussion with me about career development in the past six months.
- My team lead communicates clear goals for our team.
- My team lead has the technical expertise required to effectively manage me.
- I am satisfied with My team leadâs overall performance as a manager.
- What should My team lead keep doing?
- What should My team lead change?

This is based on Google's research what kind of leader makes teams most effective.

## Training

### Background

We want to get better at what we do every day. For that we offer the following tools:

### Courses

We pays both hours and courses for everyone to learn any (really any) of the trades that we use at stanwood. If you are a coder, who wants to learn to design: You are welcome. A QA manager who wants to learn accounting: Yes please.

Just ping the CEO or your team lead and we set you up.

### Masterclasses

Every Wednesday at 10am CET we hold a masterclass where one of our own gives a one hour talk (strictly enforced) about an interesting topic.

The head of engineering will select the mandatory audience on Monday, but everyone including clients are invited to join.

We use hangouts and youtube live streaming for that.

Check #masterclass for more info.

### Book club

Todo: Create a stackoverflow like voting system for books and summaries and discussions.


## Meet ups

#### Retreats

We meet 2x per year for a two day workshop.

#### Workshops

Between the retreats teams can meet as often as they see fit.

#### Grill the boss

Every week I will invite one happy Woody to fly in to Munich and spent an evening cooking and drinking.
I did that with the latest batch of Wookies and selected Woodies over the last weeks and I loved it.

All expenses paid of course.

As soon as we hit 52 team members I will up this to 2x week.

#### Meet a Woody

If you want to meet a Woody in person we are sponsoring the flight with up to 200â¬ and a stay at the hotel up to 100â¬.

Sent me a direct message to the CEO and explain, why you wanna go.

We will be generous.

Can be project related or just because you always wanted to meet the other person.

Groups are also allowed, for instance to do a team kick off or celebratory launch party.

## Travel and Expensing

### Background

We try to minimize the accounting overhead of traveling as much as possible.

### Booking process

All travels are organized in Trello.

1. When we need a travel, we create a card in "Planing".
2. We add location, attendees, dates and required actions in a checklist and assign who is responsible for it.
3. As soon as everything is booked, Office manager moves the card to "Booked"
4. After the event, the main attendee writes a quick summary (optional) and moves to "Add invoices"
5. We add all the invoices as we get them. Once all are in, we move them to "@Janine" and assign Janine
6. Janine ads everything in Funkes Travel Expense tool and moves to "Expensing"
7. Once we have the money, we move the Travel to "Done"

Then add your flight times to the holiday calendar with "{my name} {flight number}", in order for the organizers see your flight times.

### Hotels

Our office manager books hotels in #office centrally for everyone. Invoices are paid by the company via credit card.

### Flights

Every team member books and pays their flights, train rides or car trips themselves.

### Dinners

When two Woodies meet or meet with a client, the company pays for food.


### Expensing

Freelancers expense travels via their next invoice. Add the original receipts to the invoice (same PDF).

Employees use the Trello board process and [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LILG2ueFgdeqXS-tCdWisUCvq2DeMp45LFToFoikoLI/edit?usp=sharing) for travel and [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DlZ2iThARh8JPzB0a6RhCsJYLBft2cOzGEZBlkPAADg/edit?usp=sharing) for all other expenses.

Sent those expense forms and the original receipts non-zipped to the CEO.

You will be paid within 2-3 weeks, depending on Funke's speed to push those forms through their process.

## Time Tracking

### Background

We (mostly) invoice our clients based on hours worked.

We get paid by the hour. Our clients honour us with a huge amount of trust - in return we give them total transparency.

They expect splits by ticket or overhead tasks.

### Working hours

Totally up to you, but make it transparent to the project team and the team leads.

### Public holidays and vacations

Please use the GCal Holiday calendar. A 4-week head start would be cool, so the leads can plan the projects.

Check with the PM that we have no releases or major events planned during that time.

Make sure to answer all messages in slack at least within 1h during 10:00 and 18:00 CET. This is only required, if you have not marked the day or time span in the Holiday calendar.

Post in #status, should you be afk for more than 1 h during 10:00 and 18:00 CET

### Workshops

When participating or preparing for a workshop book on "Internal  Workshops".

### Travel

We do not pay for the time you spent traveling, so please do not book it.

However, if you bring your laptop and work while on transit, please book normally on the project and you will of course be paid.

### Masterclasses

Please book the time for participating and preparing for Masterclasses on "Internal Workshops"

### Sales

When you are helping with a pitch or a sales presentation please book on project "Sales".

### Naming

Use the jira ticket ID and a description, i.e. LEN-01 My awesome new feature
Assign a project.

Best do it realtime. Hint: Use toggl jira chrome extension

Book non-ticket project work on one of the Tasks in Toggl:

- Client communication
- Internal communication
- Ticket review
- QA
- Testing
- Deploying

Book non-project work on project Travel & Admin. Try to book as much project hours as possible.

## Offboarding

We strive to be a company that does not have to fire people.

But even the best hiring and people development process will fail from time to time and we have to part ways with a person.

We give feedback at least every 3 months during our performance reviews.

There are 5 reasons for ending or not extending a contract:

1. Gross negligence or malicious behaviour hurting a client or the company
2. Hurting another Woody or poisoning a team
3. Not following our Vision and Ideals
4. Financial strains the company cannot overcome
5. The employee asks us to end the contract

### Process

- The team lead and the CEO decide to start the process.
- All team leads discuss the issue.
- Team leads have a veto, that the CEO can override.
- The team lead of of the team member and the CEO decide to end the contract.
- The employee is told by his lead with Hannes present
- That he/she is officially on-notice for four weeks
- What changes are required to stay in the company
- That daily check-ins with Hannes and the respective Lead will be performed
- After 4 weeks the leads and Hannes review the process and decide to either
- End the contract
- Extend the contract
- Extend the on-notice period by another 4 weeks
- The employee is told the decision by the Lead with Hannes present
- Hannes will inform the company about the decision and the reasons
- Should the contract be ended, we offer a 4 week grace period during which
- The employee gets full pay
- stanwood will use all their contacts to find another engagement for the developer
- The developer must show 200% commitment during those 4 weeks including reporting every ticket when they start and end working on to the team lead and project manager

This process is only valid for reasons 3. If we ever need to lay off people due to financial strains (4) we simply honour the contracts.

Before it comes to that we

- Try to increase sales.
- Try to get funding.
- Try to find developers who can work part-time, take sabbaticals or work somewhere else for a bit.

### Last day

#### Ops

- Disable all accounts from onboarding

#### CEO

- Write a personal note to the person leaving
- Thank the person on #general

#### Person leaving

- Reply to CEO post with a personal message to the team and leave your private email to stay in touch [Optional]
- Remove stanwood GDrive
- Remove all accounts and passwords from password manager
- Remove all code repos and stanwood docs from your computer
- Remove all private data from your computer [if company computer]
- Reset all devices to factory settings [If company hardware]
- Sent hardware back to CEO [if company hardware]
- Sent last invoice (if freelancer)

## Alumni

Every team member who leaves the company on his accord will become part of the esteemed club of stanwood alumni.

They keep their email and slack account and get invited to all company retreats and workshops.

Travel expenses will be paid but not the hours.


# Support processes
## Accounting

### Tools & Processes

All in and outgoing invoices are digitised and then sent to invoice@stanwood.de (alias of info@stanwood.de).

That forwards it to candis.io for processing.

Payments are done every Monday morning from candis.io and the local tool MoneyMoney by the MD.

On the next Monday that is not the 1st of the month is closed.

The MD adds cost centres and accounts numbers to all invoices.

Our accountants (Goldstein Consulting) get an export of all data, do some accounting magic and create cost center reports for all teams.

### Tags

Every invoice get's 3 tags.

1. Type: i.e. Travel (0..9,999)
2. Company: i.e. Uber (10,000..99,999)
3. Cost center: i.e. Team android (1000..999,999)

### Cost centres

Every lead is responsible for a cost centre.

	5. Funke will do process these invoices which includes a green light from 6 different people.
	6. After 2-3 weeks you should have the money on your account.


## Processing invoices

We are using a central email 'invoice@stanwood.de' to get all invoices into our systems and in corporates'.

Those emails get forwarded to a candis.io account (just to have a central log for all emails) and then forwarded to corporates invoice address.

Corporate processes all those emails and assigns them to our office assistants. They assign a cost centre and approve it.

After 1-2 days, those invoices are assigned to our CEO who approves as well.

After that another corporate employee approves the invoice as well. With that the invoices will be paid 1-5 days later.

The whole process takes 10 business days at best and sometimes up to three weeks.
