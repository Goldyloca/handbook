# stanwood Handbook

stanwood's processes and policies

## Background

We are to be "transparent by default". We want to be equally transparent to potential clients and our team both current and future. As such this document is open-source.

We also want to be an active part of the remote-work community and want to share what we learned with other startups in an effort to bring the wonders of distributed to the world.

## Language

We use UK English both written and spoken. 

We refer to employees and freelancers as "team members" or "Woodies". New Woodies are called "Wookies".

When talking about people we use the plural to avoid female and/or male pronouns. We try to use neutral terms where-ever possible. If not possible we alternate between female and male pronouns.
