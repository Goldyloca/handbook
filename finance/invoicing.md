# Invoicing

We are using a central email 'invoice@stanwood.de' to get all invoices into our systems and in corporates'.

Those emails get forwarded to a candis.io account (just to have a central log for all emails) and then forwarded to corporates invoice address.

Corporate processes all those emails and assigns them to our office assistants. They assign a cost centre and approve it. 

After 1-2 days, those invoices are assigned to our CEO who approves as well.

After that another corporate employee approves the invoice as well. With that the invoices will be paid 1-5 days later.

The whole process takes 10 business days at best and sometimes up to three weeks.
