# Accounting

## Tools & Processes

All in and outgoing invoices are digitized and then sent to invoice@stanwood.de (alias of info@stanwood.de).

That forwards it to candis.io for processing.

Payments are done every Monday morning from candis.io and the local tool MoneyMoney by the MD.

On the next Monday that is not the 1st of the month is closed.

The MD adds cost centres and accounts numbers to all invoices.

Our accountants (Goldstein Consulting) get an export of all data, do some accounting magic and create cost center reports for all teams.

## Tags

Every invoice get's 3 tags.

1. Type: i.e. Travel (0..9,999)
2. Company: i.e. Uber (10,000..99,999)
3. Cost center: i.e. Team android (1000..999,999)

## Cost centres

Every lead is responsible for a cost centre.
