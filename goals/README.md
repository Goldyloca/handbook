## Teams [WIP]

### PM Goals [WIP]

#### GOAL 1: Improve expectation management and keep client close
##### How:
1. At least once a week: update the client about: *budget, blocker, progress*.
1. Ask the clients how updated they feel (one NPS question/month, one subjective PM estimation per week)
1. underpromise and overdeliver
 
##### Tools for Measurement [WIP]:
1. All client communication goes through hubspot. If a client question gets not answered in 1 day, we will get an alert. (operationalization still to be discussed)
2. For all active clients the PM gets a form from hubspot once a week to answer:
   1. Did you update the client about: budget, about blocker, about progress?
   1. How do you rate the client satisfaction? Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) 1-10
   
   Answers get recorded in the company property.
1. Once a month, the client gets a short Mail with asking for *Net promoter score* survey.

#### GOAL 2: Increase Product Quality
##### How
1. session based crash-free rate above 99%
2. 0% critical bug-tickets reported from the client for tickets with status "done", < 5% other bugs @qa
3. 90% of tickets pass QA at the first attempt @dev_teams
4. average app rating in stores is >4. Measured by % of 5 stars in that year.

##### Tools for Measurement [WIP]:
1. firebase session crash rate
2. client mails with bug reports, ticket created with a label (PM sets label) to be recognizable as client reportet
3. qa ticket rejection rate
4. gathered by App Annie rating

#### GOAL 3: Burn down Backlog every sprint

##### How:
1. 100% burndown of all sprint tickets
2. Average Time a ticket is in QA stays below 24h (during working days)
3. We send a QA checklist with all we have QA'd to the client at Friday with the build

##### Tools for Measurement [WIP]:
1. milestone is with 100% at end of sprint
2. report from gitlab
3. to be checked if reported in client communication (hubspot conversation)
