# Contracts

As we have access to clients production data bases, we are subject to data protection laws, non-disclosure-agreements and data-processing-agreements with all our clients.

In those contracts we are responsible to enforce the same clauses to all our team members. 

Every freelancer and employee needs to sign 3 documents:

1. Non disclosure agreement: [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Iybj-AhccoGngPzFn8lbjRYQZOjL4uFmlt-8q-pbMw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Freelance vs. Full time employee

We prefer working on a freelance basis because this 

- reduces the accounting and admin overhead by 90%
- captures our entrepreneurial spirit
- is closer to our processes 

Some states have "fake-freelancer-laws" that prohibits this practise sometimes. In those cases we go with the employment contract.
