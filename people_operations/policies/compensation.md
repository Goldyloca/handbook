# Compensation

## Background

We provide a transparent and unified payment scheme based on hourly rates that reflect the impact for the company, responsibilities and scarcity of the skill set.

## Developers and project managers

- New guys: 25€
- Mid level: 30€
- Senior: 35€
- Project lead: 40€
- Team lead: 45€

## *QA manager*

- Junior: 15€
- Mid: 20€
- Senior: 25€
- Team lead: 30€

We *do not downgrade* existing hourly rates. We will heal the existing "injustices" with a general rate increase in the next years.

## Full time employees

Full time employees get a wage based on the gross cost hourly rate + 20% (employer payment for pension health insurance, ...) x 8 h / day x 220 d / year.


So if an employee and a freelancer work those 1760 h per year, they cost the company the same amount.

220 d is the average per full time employee in Germany.

1700 h was the average of full time freelancer at stanwood last year.

**Example**


*Employee:*

Wage: 40 €/h x 8 h/d x 220 d/y x 80% = 56,320 €

Benefits: 40 €/h x 8 h/d x 220 d/y x 20% = 14,080 €

*Freelancer*

Fee: 40 €/h x 8 h/d x 220 d/y = 70,400 €
