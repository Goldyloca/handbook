# Meet ups

### Retreats

We meet 2x per year for a two day workshop.

### Workshops

Between the retreats teams can meet as often as they see fit.

### Grill the boss

Every week I will invite one happy Woody to fly in to Munich and spent an evening cooking and drinking.
I did that with the latest batch of Wookies and selected Woodies over the last weeks and I loved it.

All expenses paid of course.

As soon as we hit 52 team members I will up this to 2x week.

### Meet a Woody

If you want to meet a Woody in person we are sponsoring the flight with up to 200€ and a stay at the hotel up to 100€.

Sent me a direct message to the CEO and explain, why you wanna go. 

We will be generous.

Can be project related or just because you always wanted to meet the other person.

Groups are also allowed, for instance to do a team kick off or celebratory launch party.
