# Leadership

## 1 on 1 reviews
We do continuous performance management. Leads have regular 1 on 1 reviews with their teammembers.
We center on 5 questions:
- What are you working on?
- How are you doing; how are your OKRs/Goals coming along? 
- Is there anything impeding your work? 
- What do you need from me to be (more) successful?
- How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals?

This is the teammembers meeting. Tone and agenda should be set by the teammember. The lead is there to coach and learn.
