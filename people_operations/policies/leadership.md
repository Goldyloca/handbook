# Leadership

## 1 on 1 reviews
We do continuous performance management. Every lead has regular  1 on 1 reviews with her teammembers.
We center on 5 questions:
- What are you working on?
- How are you doing; how are your OKRs coming along? 
- Is there anything impeding your work? 
- What do you need from me to be (more) successful?
- How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals?
