Order of priorities:

## 1. Client Communication

- Keep client informed about progress and blockers 3x per week.
- Send one personal mail
- React within 15 minutes to calls.*
- React within 4 hours to emails*
- Create tickets to all issues raised within one day.*

* During business hours.

## 2. Jira Hygiene

Once a day: 

- zero the inbox
- ping project leads to estimate - if ticket update > 24h
- ping assignee - if ticket update > 1w
- Ensure:
	- tickets are well described
	- documentation regarding that ticket is up to date
	- everything discussed in Slack is synced back to Jira

## 3. Internal communication

1. Keep your lead and all devs up to date of milestones, next milestones, of the pressing issues, blockers and goals 3x per week.
2. Send an update post for all your projects in slack channel #done friday until 12:00. Keep the post numbered and think about it as a logbook.
3. for every project, include status, blockers, next milestones
4. is there a sprint in the following week, also include when the *sprint planning call* has been and who attended the planning call(s) (client, dev-teams, qa)

## 4. Sprint planning call

At least every Thursday before the sprint: Grab the client and your team (including QA) and fill the backlog of the team according to the sprint planing spreadsheet. 
Make sure all tickets are well described before the sprint starts.
All Devs should be able to work on it without further questions.
Include acceptance criteria for QA.

## 5. Keep documentation and Zeplin up to date

## 6. Upselling

Suggest features and improvements to clients.
