# Team lead

##  Philosophie

Leadership means: "Take the blame, share the fame."

1. As a leader, everything is always your fault. So you should always take actions to fix situations.

Examples: 

- if one of your team members is unhappy or not performing
- if a client or project manager is unresponsive, unclear in his briefings or confused
- if a project is not running well
- if the CEO is a tyrannt

2. As a leader, you are only a facilitator. Your team does the actually work and deserves all praise.
