# Offboarding

We strive to be a company that does not have to fire people. 

But even the best hiring and people development process will fail from time to time and we have to part ways with a person.

We give feedback at least every 3 months during our performance reviews.

There are 5 reasons for ending or not extending a contract:

- Gross negligence or malicious behaviour hurting a client or the company
Hurting another Woody or poisoning a team
Not following our Vision and Ideals
Financial strains the company cannot overcome 
The employee asks us to end the contract
Process
The leads and Hannes together decide to initiate the process for a person.
The employee is told by his Lead with Hannes present
That he/she is officially on-notice for four weeks
What changes are required to stay in the company
That daily check-ins with Hannes and the respective Lead will be performed
After 4 weeks the leads and Hannes review the process and decide to either
End the contract
Extend the contract
Extend the on-notice period by another 4 weeks
The employee is told the decision by the Lead with Hannes present
Hannes will inform the company about the decision and the reasons
Should the contract be ended, we offer a 4 week grace period during which
The employee gets full pay
stanwood will use all their contacts to find another engagement for the developer
The developer must show 200% commitment during those 4 weeks including reporting every ticket when they start and end working on to the team lead and project manager

This process is only valid for reasons 1-3. If we ever need to lay off people due to financial strains (4) we simply honour the contracts.
Before it comes to that we
Try to increase sales.
Try to get funding.
Try to find developers who can work part-time, take sabbaticals or work somewhere else for a bit.
