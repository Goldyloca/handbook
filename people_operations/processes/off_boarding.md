# Offboarding

We strive to be a company that does not have to fire people. 

But even the best hiring and people development process will fail from time to time and we have to part ways with a person.

We give feedback at least every 3 months during our performance reviews.

There are 5 reasons for ending or not extending a contract:

1. Gross negligence or malicious behaviour hurting a client or the company
2. Hurting another Woody or poisoning a team
3. Not following our Vision and Ideals
4. Financial strains the company cannot overcome 
5. The employee asks us to end the contract

## Process

- The leads and Hannes together decide to initiate the process for a person.
- The employee is told by his Lead with Hannes present
- That he/she is officially on-notice for four weeks
- What changes are required to stay in the company
- That daily check-ins with Hannes and the respective Lead will be performed
- After 4 weeks the leads and Hannes review the process and decide to either
- End the contract
- Extend the contract
- Extend the on-notice period by another 4 weeks
- The employee is told the decision by the Lead with Hannes present
- Hannes will inform the company about the decision and the reasons
- Should the contract be ended, we offer a 4 week grace period during which
- The employee gets full pay
- stanwood will use all their contacts to find another engagement for the developer
- The developer must show 200% commitment during those 4 weeks including reporting every ticket when they start and end working on to the team lead and project manager

This process is only valid for reasons 3. If we ever need to lay off people due to financial strains (4) we simply honour the contracts.

Before it comes to that we

- Try to increase sales.
- Try to get funding.
- Try to find developers who can work part-time, take sabbaticals or work somewhere else for a bit.
