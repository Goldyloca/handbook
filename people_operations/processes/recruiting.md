## Phase five: Structured interview by team members 30'

Structured interviews have been proven (Compare "Work Rules!") the highest predictor of job success. 

To mitigate the inherint personal bias (People decide within 5 minutes, if they want to hire someone) we do 5 interviews with 

1. Other team lead (ios <> android, Web <> API)
2. Team member
3. Project manager
4. Head
5. CEO

## Phase six: Decision

We only hire people where all 6 interviewers give a "Hell yeah".

If it's not "hell yeah", it's "hell no".

## Process

We are "transparent by default". Anyone can follow the process to see, who is in the pipeline.
