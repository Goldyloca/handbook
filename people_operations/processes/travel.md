# Travel and Expensing

## Background

We try to minimize the accounting overhead of traveling as much as possible. 

## Booking process

All travels are organized in Trello.

1. When we need a travel, we create a card in "Planing". 
2. We add location, attendees, dates and required actions in a checklist and assign who is responsible for it.
3. As soon as everything is booked, Office manager moves the card to "Booked"
4. After the event, the main attendee writes a quick summary (optional) and moves to "Add invoices"
5. We add all the invoices as we get them. Once all are in, we move them to "@Janine" and assign Janine
6. Janine ads everything in Funkes Travel Expense tool and moves to "Expensing"
7. Once we have the money, we move the Travel to "Done"

Then add your flight times to the holiday calendar with "{my name} {flight number}", in order for the organizers see your flight times.

## Hotels

Our office manager books hotels in #office centrally for everyone. Invoices are paid by the company via credit card.

## Flights

Every team member books and pays their flights, train rides or car trips themselves. 

## Dinners

When two Woodies meet or meet with a client, the company pays for food.


## Expensing

Freelancers expense travels via their next invoice. Add the original receipts to the invoice (same PDF).

Employees use the Trello board process and [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LILG2ueFgdeqXS-tCdWisUCvq2DeMp45LFToFoikoLI/edit?usp=sharing) for travel and [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DlZ2iThARh8JPzB0a6RhCsJYLBft2cOzGEZBlkPAADg/edit?usp=sharing) for all other expenses.

Sent those expense forms and the original receipts non-zipped to the CEO.

You will be paid within 2-3 weeks, depending on Funke's speed to push those forms through their process.
