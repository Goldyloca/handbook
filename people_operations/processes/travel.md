# Travel and Expensing

## Background

We try to minimize the accounting overhead of traveling as much as possible. 

Because invoices for flights are issued to the travel - not the company - this creates an accounting nightmare.

The bank or credit card statement just says "123.24â‚¬ Lufthansa". Then the hunt for the receipts beginns.

So we turn this around. The person who get's the invoice pays themselve and then expenses.

## Booking process

All travels are organized in Trello.

1. When we need a travel, we create a card in "Planing". 
2. We add location, attendees, dates and required actions in a checklist and assign who is responsible for it.
3. As soon as everything is booked, Office manager moves the card to "Booked"
4. After the event, the main attendee writes a quick summary (optional) and moves to "Done"

Then add your flight times to the holiday calendar with "{my name} {flight number}", in order for the organizers see your flight times.

## Hotels

Our office manager books hotels in #office centrally for everyone. Invoices are paid by the company via credit card.

## Flights

Every team member books and pays their flights, train rides or car trips themselves. 

## Dinners

When two Woodies meet or meet with a client, the company pays for food.

## What we pay for
