# Training

## Background

We want to get better at what we do every day. For that we offer the following tools:

## Courses

We pays both hours and courses for everyone to learn any (really any) of the trades that we use at stanwood. If you are a coder, who wants to learn to design: You are welcome. A QA manager who wants to learn accounting: Yes please.

Just ping the CEO or your team lead and we set you up. 

## Masterclasses

Every Wednesday at 10am CET we hold a masterclass where one of our own gives a one hour talk (strictly enforced) about an interesting topic. 

The head of engineering will select the mandatory audience on Monday, but everyone including clients are invited to join.

We use hangouts and youtube live streaming for that. 

Check #masterclass for more info.

## Book club

Todo: Create a stackovrflow like voting system for books and summaries and discussions.
