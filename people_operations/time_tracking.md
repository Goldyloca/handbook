# Time Tracking

## Background

We (mostly) invoice our clients based on hours worked. 

We get paid by the hour. Our clients honour us with a huge amount of trust - in return we give them total transparency.

They expect splits by ticket or overhead tasks.

## Working hours

Totally up to you, but make it transparent to the project team and the team leads.

## Public holidays and vacations

Please use the GCal Holiday calendar. A 4-week head start would be cool, so the leads can plan the projects.

Check with the PM that we have no releases or major events planned during that time.

Make sure to answer all messages in slack at least within 1h during 10:00 and 18:00 CET. This is only required, if you have not marked the day or time span in the Holiday calendar.

Post in #status, should you be afk for more than 1 h during 10:00 and 18:00 CET

## Namining

Use the jira ticket ID and a description, i.e. LEN-01 My awesome new feature
Assign a project.

Best do it realtime. Hint: Use toggl jira chrome extension

Book non-ticket project work on one of the Tasks in Toggl:

- Client communication
- Internal communication
- Ticket review
- QA
- Testing
- Deploying

Book non-project work on project Travel & Admin. Try to book as much project hours as possible.

## Invoicing

Use the hours from Toggl. No need for 

The payment process will take between 7 and 21 days depending on corporate's speed and if your invoice is correct.
