# People development

## Background

stanwood is the embodiment of change. We want to improve every day. One important step (others are Analyses, Planning, Doing and Collecting Data) is the Review.

## 0. Performance review

Every team member has a performance review meeting with their team lead every quarter. 

The Q3 review is the Annual Review where we also add 360° feedback.

Apart from a general feedback, your lead will discuss these points:

- Developer ideals
- Team KPIs and how you might contribute
- 360° feedback

With the Q1 feedback in 2019 we will add personal goals and personal KPIs.

## 1. Goals

Numerous studies have shown, that setting goals increases a teams performance and personal happiness. 

We already have our company goals for each year.

We will start developing (bottom up) goals for every team in 2018 and for every person in 2019.

Those goals can - but must not overlap - with the higher team and company goals.

Goal achievement are purely developmental and will not be tied to your compensation or career. 

## 2. KPI

We are blessed with numerous sources of data that can help us understand our performance as a group. 

When setting goals we try to use data to inform our decision making.

We also use data to identify patterns and improve our operations.

We never use data to control or punish people. 

KPIs are purely developmental and will not be tied to you compensation or career.

2. Feature implementation speed
3. Bug fixing speed
4. % worked on bugs vs. features

## 3. 360° Feedback

We want to give you a fuller picture of how you are perceived by our fellow Woodies and even clients (for project managers).

For that end we identified up to 7 people each Woody worked with most - that will give anonymized feedback and vice versa.

This survey is purely developmental. Nothing you say here will impact compensation or the career of that person or yours.

### I. HOW TO

### III. NOTES
1. This survey is totally anonymous towards the person you give feedback to.
2. Hannes sees all answers and your name.
3. Team leads see all answers for their team and your name.
4. The team lead will synthesize all feedback to ensure anonymity. 
5. If you do not have 7 people on your list, just click "NEXT" and leave those sections empty.

## 4. Leadership feedback

Our team leads will get a bit more detailed feedback. 
Every team member will answer the following 12 questions

- My team lead gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
- My team lead does not "micromanage".
- My team lead shows consideration for me as a person.
- My team lead values the perspective I bring to the team, even if it is different from his own.
- My team lead keeps the team focused on our priority results/deliverables.
- My team lead regularly shares relevant information from his bosses.
- My team lead has had a meaningful discussion with me about career development in the past six months.
- My team lead communicates clear goals for our team.
- My team lead has the technical expertise required to effectively manage me.
- I am satisfied with My team lead’s overall performance as a manager.
- What should My team lead keep doing?
- What should My team lead change?

This is based on Google's research what kind of leader makes teams most effective.
