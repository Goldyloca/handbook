# Managing Director's Manual

## I. Background

True to our mantra of transparency and openness I want to share how to ”handle” me. This is both an attempt to make the communication you have with me more pleasant, productive and inspiring, but also I would like you to help me grow into a better person.

### General Rule

9 times out of 10 I am wrong and what I ask for is half baked, ill-informed or down right stupid. Please always hold my feet to the fire and challenge me.

If I rub you wrong, please know that I am a flawed person with limited knowledge, an ego, short attention span and a flaring personality. 

In my heart I love people - everyone. If I am not my usually loving and caring self: I am probably under a stress or distracted. 

## II. What excites me

Things that make me very happy:

### 1. Self reflection, ownership and leadership

If you start a meaningful conversation with me and your first thought is: ”What should I have done different to prevent this?” I will immediately fall in love with you. 

Also: If you see something that is not as it should be and you take it upon yourself to rectify the situation even though it's not your core responsibility - what I call "ownership" - I might as well ask for your hand in marriage.

Finally: If you see a situation that should be changed, but you need to convince other people, fight for it, go against popular opinion and feel very uncomfortable the whole time, I will adopt you - this is true "leadership".

### 2. Intelligence 

I enjoy deep thought, data and abstract thinking. If you argue from an experience you once (or twice) had - especially, if it runs counter to data or my experience, I will lose interest and might ignore you.

### 3. Wits

I enjoy laughing and make other people laugh. My heroes are Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Monty Python, Eddy Izzard, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart and [UK inventor of the office]. Play on words especially entertain me. 

Feel free to make fun of me, but be smart about it.

### 4. Storytelling

I am captivated by great storytellers. If you can tell a story over half an hour with self deprecation, I am all ears.

### 5. Self motivation

I like people, how understand the goals we work towards it. You can make me very happy, by suggestion some improvement or idea all the time.

### 6. Grand visions and passions

I enjoy people who want to change the world or have a passion for a particular topic - can be totally unrelated to coding and stanwood.

### 8. Sharing successes and gratitude

Nothing we achieve could be done without the help of our team. Be humble, share success and express gratitude on a daily basis, will get you into my good book.

## III. What annoys me

### 1. Whining

I do not like being around people who complain constantly. Case in point: I have broken up a number relations with people working in corporate. I had friends who do nothing but complain about their stupid bosses and co workers every time we meet.

*Love it, leave it of or change it!*

If you want to do either of these things, I am happy to spent an evening with you and working on a plan...

But complain over and over again about the same thing, without any plan to change the situation, I would rather spend the time with my lovely wife, my kids or one of the many inspiring Woodies.

### 2. Misuse of power/politicking

Being a freedom loving guy, I cannot stand people who use the power for their own gain or play politics. 

Calling rank, manipulating people or using any kind of force or leverage annoys the crab out of me. 

Win people with argument, wit, gentle nudging or charm, please.

### 3. -ismns

Being a straight, white, male, central-European enjoying a superb (and free) education, publicly available (and free) health care system and the rule of law puts us unto a unique and blessed position. But we did not earn this. We were just super lucky.

Our nationality, talents, body, religions, race, gender, sexual orientation was handed to us by chance. Feel superior or even worst - treating other people inferior, just because they were less lucky at the throw of the dice, is simply ignorant.

We discriminate a 1000 times per day without even realising it and with that we are telling people - who were not that lucky - that they are second class: 

- using the male from of pronouns or job titles
- using CET as default time zone
- giving our kids gendered toys (dolls for girls, lego for boys) or clothes
- giving our kids children books with mum and dad, or only whites
- wishing "Happy Christmas"
- praising hard skills over soft skills

### 4. Blaming

There is a well researched tendency of humans to attribute positive things that happen to our own prowess and negative things to external factors.

We should always be aware of that fact. In case of miss-fortune, always ask yourself: What could *I* have done differently. 

Even if someone else made a mistake: You are still at fault, because you did not prevent that person doing that mistake.

### 5. Negativity 

We are a company of doers and makers. And everything that happens to us, has value - even our failures, because we can learn something. 

Bitching, cursing and moaning about things that go wrong or when people fucked up is not good for your soul and also not helping fixing the situation.

### 6. Keeping negative feedback to yourself

I nearly ran stanwood into the ground. Three friends founded and we never put our cards on the table, because we wanted to avoid conflict for the sake of our friendship.

I will never make that mistake again.

If you are annoyed: Say it. If you do not like something: Say it.

And do not wait. Wait 24h to cool down and then talk to the person. Especially, if it is me.

If you bottle it up, it will only fester and explode one day in an epic eruption of anger.

### 7. Wasting my time

Time is my most valuable asset. Ever minute I work, I do not spent with my family. So you better not waste my time. Or anyone else's for that matter.

Think deep, read up, come up with a plan or options before you contact me.

### 8. Missing empathy

Very few people are truly malicious. When it seems to you, that someone is stupid, evil or mean, it's probably just missing information. Always assume ignorance before malice. 

### 9. Hiding and not-communicating

Working in a distributed company is management on steroids. If you hide because you are shy or ashamed, you will not succeed and you will waste my and someone else's time. So don't!

## My faults

### 1. Micromanagement

I build stanwood from the ground up. Everything anyone in the company does, is something I did before and then asked someone else to take this over.

Naturally I have the strong, that I know better than anyone else, how that should be done. Which is obviously total BS.

Also: The company currently runs at 10% awesomeness. We loose money on more than 50% of projects, more than half our clients are not satisfied with us and we frustrate one another a lot.

My ego, stoked by my education, experience und history will quite naturally make me think, that I have all the answers.

On an abstract level, I do know that this is BS. In every circumstance - especially when under pressure - I tend to lose that self reflection.

### 2. Anger issues

I get angry a lot and fast - please see the list of what might trigger that. You do not deserve that. And I know that - once I cool off.

I do not hold grudges though. Even if you fuck up and I dress you down, we can be buddies again a day later.

### 3. Patience

I do live a high paced life style and prefer action over reflection. I am not the most patient person, when someone states the obvious or uses long winded arguments. 

### 4. Kindness and cowards

I am a very kind and harmony loving person. I tend to give people more trust and time to proof themselves in order to create harmony. 

I also do not like conflict, uncertainty and tend to give in just to avoid fighting with another person.

## IV. How to give me feedback

1. Wait 24h for me to cool down (or sober up).
2. Give feedback to me privately. Ideally in a call.
3. Tell me how you feel now and how I made you feel at the time.
4. If there are certain character traits of mine, that annoy you with me: Collect examples and share them with me.
