# Slack

## Background

We use slack as our daily real time communication tool for projects and our main non-project communication.

## Profile

Add a full name, picture, phone number and email

Username: @firstname if taken @nickname

Same on every other platform that we use.

## Channels

#general Official stuff

#status Good morning, be-right-back, back, good night + what are you going to do today

#random GIFs, cat videos etc. to

#programming_X General programming talks and ask for help

## Guidelines

When switching project, ping both @pms in the project channel.

When responding to todos in slack, open a thread, use "On it {time}" (i.e. "On it in 1h") and "Done"/:white_check_mark:

Project channels starting with "_". All real-time discussion belongs there. acknowledge

Jira, Zeplin, Github, Bitrise post to the channel project channel.

No project talk in direct messages, as this is lost to the company.

When asking someone something, always use @username. Some developers are a member of dozens of channels and might miss your question.

BTW: Hannes is sometimes offline for a couple of hours when with a client. Best ask via comment in a Jira ticket then.

Always use threats. 

## What to use slack for

- Fun and giggles

## What NOT to use slack for

- Real time discussions: Jump on a call.
