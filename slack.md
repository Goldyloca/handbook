# Slack

## Background

We use slack as our daily real time communication tool for projects and our main non-project communication.

## Profile

Add a full name, picture, phone number and email

Username: @firstname if taken @nickname

Same on every other platform that we use.

## Channels

### #general
Official stuff. Only the CEO posts here.

### #status 

Post "Good morning", "be-right-back", "back", "good night" + what are you going to do today.

The first line of your post and the first emoij will become your profile status message. Use it to communicate your availability to people who try to reach you.

When leaving for vacation please use this template:  
`:desert_island: on vacation till August 23rd`

### #random

GIFs, cat videos etc. to

### #programming_X

General programming talks and ask for help

### Tackleberry

Our very own police bot will sent you reminders that require your actions from time to time. 

- Tickets that need your estimation
- Tickets that need to be moved
- Tickets that have are already 50% over estimate: Update the `Remaining estimate` and inform your pm
- Tickets that have are already 100% over estimate: Update the `Remaining estimate` and inform your pm

## Guidelines

When switching project, ping both @pms in the project channel.

When responding to todos in slack, open a thread, use "On it {time}" (i.e. "On it in 1h") and "Done"/:white_check_mark:

Project channels starting with "_". All real-time discussion belongs there. acknowledge

Jira, Zeplin, Github, Bitrise post to the channel project channel.

Please do not hold project talk in direct messages, as this is lost to the company. Use a public channel instead.

When asking someone something, always use @username. Some developers are a member of dozens of channels and might miss your question.

BTW: Hannes is sometimes offline for a couple of hours when with a client. Best ask via comment in a Jira ticket then.

Always use threats.
