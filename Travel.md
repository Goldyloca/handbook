# Travel

## Background

We try to minimize the accounting overhead of traveling as much as possible. 

## Process

All travels are organized in Trello.

1. When we need a travel, we create a card in "Planing". 
2. We add location, attendees, dates and required actions in a checklist and assign who is responsible for it.
3. As soon as everything is booked, Office manager moves the card to "Booked"
4. After the event, the main attendee writes a quick summary (optional) and moves to "Add invoices"
5. We add all the invoices as we get them. Once all are in, we move them to "@Janine" and assign Janine
6. Janine ads everything in Funkes Travel Expense tool and moves to "Expensing"
7. Once we have the money, we move the Travel to "Done"

## Hotels

Our office manager books hotels in #office centrally for everyone. Invoices are paid by the company via credit card.

## Flights

Every team member books and pays their flights, train rides or car trips themselves. 

Freelancers expense travels via their next invoice. Add the original receipts to the invoice (same PDF).

Employees use the Trello board process.

## Dinners

When two Woodies meet or meet with a client, the company pays for food.

Expensing works the same as for flights.
