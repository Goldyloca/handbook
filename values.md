We communicate openly and timely. 

We are not shy, hide in slack or keep grudges.

We actively propose changes to our standard architecture. 

We write clean code. That incudes

- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Injection
- Single Responsibility Principle (but not strictly adhered to)
- Testable Code 
- Short functions - start to finish should be visible on the screen
- Clear and understandable naming 

## V. Transparency and openness

We believe that transparency in itself is a virtue. The more we act in the open, the less likely we are to fall victim to internal politics or mistrust.

We also want to enable potential clients and team members to really know, what they are getting themselves into.

4. Code and tickets on non open-source projects
5. Passwords and production keys (1password).

### Openness and honesty

We prefer a hard truth over mollycoddling. But even a hard truth can be told kindly.

We embrace numbers and data over gut feeling or single experiences.

But we also know, that data is only a small part of the truth.

We do not misuse numbers. We know, they are biased and need interpretation.

### Failure

Human beings have been wrong most of the time in their history. 

We try to fail often and fast.

Failure is the best way too learn.

We admit failures - even brag about them.

## II. Hacker mindset

We work smart:

Automate everything.

Reuse existing solutions.

Do not reinvent wheel.

We work super efficient. 

We understand the 80/20-rule.

We constantly review our tools and processes. 

We believe in team work.

End result and time to market is far more valuable than personal credit.

## III. Constant change

We always try to improve ourselves and others.

We always try to improve our processes and policies: They should help, not hamper.

We are open to new suggestions and improvements. 

We try out new things as soon as possible.

## IV. Ownership

We take personal responsibility for our products.

If something is broken, we make sure it is fixed.

If someone must do something, we pound them into action - repeatedly.

We take personal responsibility of tasks

We never ignore an email or post when someone uses our handle.

We acknowledge questions or tasks within 1h in slack or 24h in email.

If we cannot complete it right away, we give an ETA.

Should we not be able to hold that ETA, we inform the other with a new ETA asap.

We test and iterate our output and our processes as often as possible.

## III. Love it, leave it or change it

We are hackers - we do own things the best we can despite imperfections of outside world.

Instead of complaining we focus on what we can control.

## IV. Respect, Friendship and Support

We are a family and talk friendly, respectfully and helpful.

The team is more important than the individual.

Unless someone falls on hard times: sickness, personal problems, financial issues.

In those cases we support unconditionally.

We embrace diversity.
Nationality, language, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities or mental health.
We cannot have it colourful enough.

We don't disclose what someone tells us in trust.

We support each other wherever we can.

We don't let people go lightly.
We review, feedback, mentor and give second changes.
We help people we let go, to find a new job.

Sexual harassment or discrimination, both active and by passive toleration is not

We do not tolerate sexual harassment, discrimination based on

- Age
- Disability
- Race
- Nationality
- Religious belief or lack of religious belief
- Life expectancy
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Transgender status

, violent acts, threats or encouragement of violence, fighting, bullying, coercion or use of abusive or threatening words directed to, about or against a team member, client or third party, even in a joking manner. Violations of this value is a fireable offence. 

## V. Working remotely

We work where we can work best: near our families, at those places we choose to because we want, not because we must.

We treat each other the same - despite our location.

Working remotely can be a challenge:
When someone annoys us, we assume ignorance before bad intentions.

Make an extra effort at communication.

We want to be able whenever, where-ever and how much we want. Towards that end we build our processes around asynchronous work, document everything and try to avoid the need for real time communication and collaboration.
