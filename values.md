## 2. Document everything


I. Openness, transparency and honesty
We prefer a hard truth over mollycoddling. 
We embrace numbers
We prefer numbers over gut feeling.
We use numbers wherever we can. 
But we also know, that they are only a small part of the truth.
We do not misuse numbers.
Human beings have been wrong most of the time in their history
We try to fail often and fast.
Failure is the only way too learn.
We admit failures - even brag about them.
II. Hacker mindset
We work smart:
Automate everything.
Reuse existing solutions.
Do not reinvent wheel.
We work super efficient. 
We understand the 80/20-rule.
We constantly review our tools and processes. 
We believe in team work.
End result and time to market is far more valuable than personal credit.
III. Constant change
We always try to improve ourselves and others.
We always try to improve our processes and policies: They should help, not hamper.
We are open to new suggestions and improvements. 
We try out new things as soon as possible.
IV. Ownership
We take personal responsibility for our products.
If something is broken, we make sure it is fixed.
If someone must do something, we pound them into action - repeatedly.
We take personal responsibility of tasks
We never ignore an email or post when someone uses our handle.
We acknowledge questions or tasks within 1h in slack or 24h in email.
If we cannot complete it right away, we give an ETA.
Should we not be able to hold that ETA, we inform the other with a new ETA asap.
We test and iterate our output and our processes as often as possible.
III. Love it, leave it or change it
We are hackers - we do own things the best we can despite imperfections of outside world.
Instead of complaining we focus on what we can control.
IV. Respect, Friendship and Support
We are a family and talk friendly, respectfully and helpful.
The team is more important than the individual.
Unless someone falls on hard times: sickness, personal problems, financial issues.
In those cases we support unconditionally.
We embrace diversity.
Nationality, language, religion, gender, sexual orientation...
We cannot have it colourful enough.
We don't disclose what someone tells us in trust.
We support each other wherever we can.
We don't let people go lightly.
We review, feedback, mentor and give second changes.
We help people we let go, to find a new job.
V. Working remotely
We work where we can work best: near our families, at those places we choose to because we want, not because we must.
We treat each other the same - despite our location.
Working remotely can be a challenge:
Assume the other person means well. 
Make an extra effort at communication.

1. Vision
We want to build awesome software the most fun way.

To achieve that, we need happy clients.

Clients are happy, when

we deliver awesome products in time and budget and
give the clients a sense that we are on top of things at all times.
Thats:

Ownership

Every single one of us is 100% responsible to deliver a quality service. It is never "someone else's problem"

When we see project stuck: We ping someone
If we see a bug: We ping the PM.
If we get a stupid requirement: We push back.
